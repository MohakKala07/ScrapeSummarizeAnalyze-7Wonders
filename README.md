# ScrapeSummarizeAnalyze-7Wonders

This project explores the 7 Modern Wonders of the World through the lens of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves:

- 🌐 **Web Scraping**: Extracting detailed content from the Wikipedia pages of each wonder.
- 📝 **Text Summarization**: Generating concise summaries using NLP techniques.
- 📊 **ROUGE Score Evaluation**: Comparing generated summaries with reference summaries using ROUGE metrics.
- 🔍 **Text Analysis**: Performing in-depth linguistic and statistical analysis on the scraped content.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete NLP pipeline — from data collection to evaluation — while gaining insights into the textual representation of these iconic landmarks.
